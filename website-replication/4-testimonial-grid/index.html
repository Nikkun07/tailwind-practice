                        "So as a joke, I went to my friend's house wearing Suisei's wig and clothes and bringing a cup labeled "Suipiss". I could barely stop my laughter as he went as red as a tomato and looked at it from head to toe with a bit of drool in his mouth. The way he stared made me feel a bit funny too, but I decided to tease him more by pissing in the cup. He asked me, "Are you serious?" and I said "Yep Sui."

                        He went silent for what seemed like forever, so I asked him, "What's the matter Sui?" He said he's confused, but then his boner got really hard, which made me pour the Suipiss into his gaping mouth. I expected him to scream, "Stop!" as I held his chin and tipped the cup back, but he instead shouted "Oh God, Suipiss!" which made me pull out my 5-gallon Suipiss jug. Before I knew it, he had swallowed the full 5 gallons.
                        
                        The Suipiss was so yellow, it stained his face and clothes as the smell of ringo juice filled the room. He then said, "I want Suipiss from the source!" and seeing that we've already gone that far and we were already covered in Suipiss, I shoved my yellow, dripping Suicock in his mouth and obliged. A few hours later, the jerk went all pale and said to me "Why did we do that? Now I'm a fucking piss fetishist." But he still looked so cute all confused like that, so I took pity on him and reassured while wiping my piss off his face, Let's just pretend it's still Ringo Juice”

                        "Glasses are really versatile. First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly become beautiful, or have girls wearing glasses flashing those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist's glasses and putting them on like, "Haha, got your glasses!" That's just way too cute! Also, boys with glasses! I really like when their glasses have that suspicious looking gleam, and it's amazing how it can look really cool or just be a joke. I really like how it can fulfill all those abstract needs. Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too! It's actually so much fun! You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet. I really want Luna to try some on or Marine to try some on to replace her eyepatch. We really need glasses to become a thing in hololive and start selling them for HoloComi. Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Glasses?"
